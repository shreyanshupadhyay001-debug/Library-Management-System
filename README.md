1. Project Topic

Library Book Management System (Simple Python-Based Project)

2. Short Problem Statement

Managing books manually in a small library often leads to errors, difficulty in tracking book availability, and time-consuming entries.
There is no simple automated system to add books, issue or return books, or view which books are available.

To address this, a basic Python-based library management system is proposed.

3. Objectives

To develop a simple system that can add, store, and manage book information in a structured way.

To automate the issuing and returning of books.

To provide quick access to available book records with minimal manual work.

4. Functional Requirements

The system must allow adding new books with title, author, and unique ID.

The system shall store book information in a lightweight format (JSON).

The system must allow issuing a book and updating its status.

The system must allow returning a book and restoring its availability.

The system must display all available books upon user request.

The system should maintain updated data even after program closure.

6. GitHub Repository Link

GitHub Link:
https://github.com/shreyanshupadhyay001-debug/Library-Management-System

7. Steps Followed in Setting Up the GitHub Repository

Created a new GitHub repository named Library-Management-System.

Added a README.md file to describe the project.

Added the main Python file library.py.

Created a data/ folder and added books.json to store book records.

Created a docs/ folder for project documentation.

Uploaded the use-case diagram into the docs folder.

Verified the folder structure and committed all changes.

Final GitHub Folder Structure:
Library-Management-System/
│
├── README.md
├── library.py
├── data/
│   └── books.json
└── docs/
    └── use_case_diagram.png

8. Challenges Faced

Difficulty choosing a simple project that fits the assignment requirements.

Learning how to create and upload project documentation using a CASE tool.

Understanding GitHub folder structure and how to create nested folders.

Managing JSON data handling in Python.

9. Solution to the Problem

A small but efficient Library Management System was created using Python.
The project accomplishes book addition, issuing, returning, and availability tracking.
A use-case diagram was created using a CASE tool to document system interactions.
The entire project was organized in a GitHub repository for version control and structured documentation.
This solution reduces manual workload and helps maintain accurate book availability records.

10. Conclusion

The assignment successfully demonstrates the use of CASE tools, GitHub, and basic Python programming to build a small computational project.
Through structured requirements, diagramming, coding, and repository management, a complete software mini-project was documented and developed.
